On first run you need to run
`python discordBot.py`

and then copy the spotify URL out of the terminal that it gives you and give access to the spotify API
Copy the URL that you get redirected to and paste it in the terminal. this is a first use thing so you shouldn't have to do this again.

To run the bot in the background do some shit like this idk
`nohup python -u discordBot.py &`

If you want the output of the bot to be logged you can run
`nohup python -u discordBot.py > output.txt &`
